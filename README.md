# dotfiles

This are my personal dotfiles. Some of them are probably outdated but I like to keep it as reference.

- The `fresh-install.sh` can be used when you're setting up a new MacBook. I've used several times.
- .slate` file stores all my shortcuts to my daily used apps. I never use Command + Tab to select apps.
- `ITerm2.itermcolors` some slightly changes on the colors to look nicer for me.
- `keyboard.sh` fix the keystroke limits

## Manual steps

Stuff that is not automated yet.
